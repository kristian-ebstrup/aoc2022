# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to Advent of Code 2022, solved using Rust. The handling of the input files is (somewhat) shamelessly copied from [Basile Henry's Advent of Code 2020](https://github.com/basile-henry/aoc2020/), while the CLI is built using [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap).

# To Run
To solve and output the desired day and part:

    cargo run <day> <part>

For example, to run day 1, part 1, simply type:

    cargo run 1 1

To run both parts of a given day, input "0" for the part:

    cargo run <day> 0
